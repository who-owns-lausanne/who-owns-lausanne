# Who owns Lausanne?

## Abstract
Using cadastral data, we propose a solution to interpret the real estate area in Lausanne. Our goal is to advocate the public across real estate monopoly, leveraging public-domain data and producing valuable insights. Applying data analysis we attempt to relate real estate owners and eccessively high cost of rent and the price of apartment. Moreover, we try to understand the data from a political point of view, with the ultimately hope to show a trasparent situation of this unknown market, _for the good of our society._


## Research questions
 - Who owns Lausanne?
 - What proportion of real estate is possessed by companies/privates...?
 - What proportion of real estate is possessed by non-swiss entities?
 - Who are the richest private real estate owners?
 - How are they involved in local/cantonal politics?

## Dataset
**--> open swiss data but not on opendata.swiss**

The basis for our analysis is the data which is published by the land cadastre of the city of Lausanne on [map.lausanne.ch](map.lausanne.ch).
It features information for each parcel including the owner, the area, and the position. The dataset is described on [this page](https://www.asitvd.ch/chercher/catalogue.html?view=sheet&guid=486&catalog=main&type=complete&preview=search_list).
Here is an example screenshot and data for the Bel-Air building in the centre of Lausanne:

Additionally, we might want to want to estimate the real estate surface of the buildings. This is not in the dataset above. However, we can use the data for building heights extracted from a LIDAR scan of the canton. This dataset is also described on [asitvd.ch](https://www.asitvd.ch/chercher/catalogue.html?view=sheet&guid=553&catalog=main&type=complete&preview=search_list).

Both datasets are available for free for research institutions.
We contacted the _service du secrétariat général et cadastre_ of the city of Lausanne on Friday, 2 November.
They confirmed that the data is available for free for students – in general. However, the responsible person was out of office and will reach back to us on Monday.

**How to process and enrich the data. Discuss data size and format if relevant.**
